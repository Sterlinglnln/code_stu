#include <iostream> // This line includes the iostream library, which is necessary for input and output operations in C++
// The iostream library provides functionalities for reading from and writing to the console
using namespace std; // This line allows us to use standard names from the std namespace without prefixing them with std::

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console
    // The cout object is used to output data to the console
    // The << operator is used to send the string "Hello, World!" to the cout object
    // The endl manipulator is used to insert a newline character and flush the output buffer
    // This ensures that the output is displayed immediately in the console
    // The program will output "Hello, World!" followed by a new line in the console window
    system("pause"); // This line is used to pause the console window in some environments
    // It allows the user to see the output before the program exits
    // Note: system("pause") is not recommended for production code
    // as it is platform-dependent and may not work on all systems.
    // A better alternative is to use cin.get() or similar methods
    cin.get(); // Wait for user input before closing the console window
    // This line ensures that the console window remains open until the user presses Enter
    // This is useful for debugging or when running the program in an IDE
    // The program will terminate after the user presses Enter
    // This allows the user to see the output before the program exits
    return 0; // Return 0 indicates successful completion of the program
}
// This program prints "Hello, World!" to the console
